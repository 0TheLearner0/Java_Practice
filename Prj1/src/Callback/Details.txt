-Callback-

Simple example using a callback, where passing 'this' allows one
class to invoke methods on another class.

1. We define an interface for callback

2. Class A(Button) that performs an action and notifies the
	listener
	
	* Register the listener
	*Simulate an event, like a button click

3. Class B(App inheriting EventListener Interface and uses 'this' to register itself
	* Pass the current object (App instance)
	* Override the onEvent method for the callback
